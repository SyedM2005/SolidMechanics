# SolidMechanics
This includes the source code(in MATLAB) for the course Solid Mechanics project. It is on the topic of Mohr Circle.

Mohr Circle is the graphical representation of transformation, mainly used in mechanical calculations, such as normal and shear stress.

When we apply initial normal and shear stresses on a plane and if we subject the object to rotation, the normal and shear stress in the preset coordinate system changes.
In this we are able to get special cases like 0 shear stress and getting only normal stress known as principal stress or maximum shear stress.

This code is written in MATLAB using basic conditional statements and plotting and labelling functions.

The quiver container helps in plotting vector lines as arrows, you know, for the magnitude and direction.

Hope you understand the code!!!
